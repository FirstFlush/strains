# Cannabis Strains Database

## Overview
This repository houses a comprehensive database of cannabis strains, initially sourced from [KushyApp cannabis dataset](https://github.com/kushyapp). The original data, formatted for MySQL, has been converted and normalized into a PostgreSQL format. It's designed to be a starting point for anyone interested in analyzing or expanding their knowledge on various cannabis strains and their characteristics.

## Features
- **PostgreSQL Format**: The database has been converted to a PostgreSQL-friendly format for ease of use and broader compatibility.
- **Normalized Schema**: The original flat data structure has been transformed into a normalized database schema, making queries more efficient and the data easier to understand and extend.
- **Ongoing Updates**: As new cannabis-related data is collected through various web scraping efforts, the database will be continually updated and expanded.
